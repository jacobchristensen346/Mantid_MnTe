Procedure for processing MnTe scattering data and calculating the PDF

Create new UB matrix (if needed) using MnTe_mesh.py:
--Open up MnTe_mesh.py
--Change the variable "start" to the first run number of the desired range of runs to be
	processed. This should correspond to the beginning of the chosen temperature.
--Update "newUBFile" according to the correct temperature (do not change "UBfile"). 
--Run the script, and a new UB matrix will be created.

Process the scattering data using MnTe_norm.py:
--Open up MnTe_norm.py
--Ensure the directory variables at the start point to the right path.
--Update variable "start" to the first run number for the given temp.
--Update variable "LoadCC" to either True or False.
--Update the variable "temp" according to temperature, and append 'Total' if LoadCC = False, or
	'CC' if LoadCC = True.
--Update variable "UBfile" according to temperature
--Execute the script to process the runs. This will generate a new mantid workspace, 
	which will be saved into a folder according to its temperature.

Generate a subtraction workspace:
--Open up subtractionScript.py. 
--Ensure that "startDir" gives the correct path.
--Update the variable 'fName' with the appropriate temperatures. 
--Load in the workspaces which you would like to subtract from one another, and update 
	"ws1" and "ws2" according to these names (the script will subtract ws1 from ws2).
--Run the script, and a subtraction workspace will be saved.

Calculate PDF with calculate_fft.py:
--Open up calculate_fft.py
--Ensure that "start_dir" gives the right path. 
--Update variables "name_fft" and "name_int" according to temperature (the desired file names that the
	intermediate and fft workspaces will be saved under).
--Update variable "ws" to the name of the workspace to be processed. 
--Update "slice_ws" to True if you want to reduce the size of the workspace. If true, the SliceMDHisto 
	algorithm will run; make sure to update this to slice through the desired number of bins 
	(Take care that the slice will still be centered on the origin, else DeltaPDF3D will not work).
	Recommended slice: Start='80,75,80',End='921,859,921'
--Update parameters in DeltaPDF3D if desired. Recommended options (so far):
	DeltaPDF3D(InputWorkspace=ws,
		IntermediateWorkspace='intermediate',
		OutputWorkspace='fft',
		Method='KAREN',
		KARENWidth=7)
--Run the script. Two new workspaces (fft and intermediate) will be saved.
