WindowFunction:
	Blackman seems to work best
	Inadequate: Gaussian, Tukey, Kaiser (all with WindowParameter set to 0.5)

3DPDF above temp of ordering with no subtraction:
	Results in very similar patterns as found below temp of ordering
	Appears to have both the atomic scattering pattern matching the unit cell
	and the short-range magnetic scattering pattern present

3DPDF 370K Inelastic
	Does not seem to have any major feature differences when compared to
	elastic scattering, only small things that may be noise.
	The dimmer spots appear brighter for elastic scattering

Punch and fill
	increasing "Size" seems to decrease the extent of the resulting pdf pattern
